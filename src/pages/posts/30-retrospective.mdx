# 30 Years of life retrospective

So, its now been 30 years since I have been born. Big deal? No, but I like thinking about this and just want to write out my thoughs on possible one third of me life being over

## Where to start?

Well lets start with age 0 to 16. Seems fitting since in Iceland your junior college years starts at 16 years old.

I'm a third child. I have a sister and had a brother. My parents divorced when I was young. My father a Icelandic farmer and my mom a Norwegian [tanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning_(leather)).
